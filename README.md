# DynamicShield Hook  

**DynamicShield Hook** is an innovative solution for liquidity providers (LPs) designed to address key challenges in decentralized finance (DeFi), such as impermanent loss (IL) and asset devaluation. Built for Uniswap V4, it enhances liquidity management by dynamically adjusting fees, safeguarding inactive assets, and enabling LPs to capture market recovery opportunities.

## Features  

- **Dynamic Fees:** Automatically adjust pool fees based on balance conditions to protect LPs and promote trading activity.  
- **Safety Conversion:** Convert out-of-range assets into stable tokens to mitigate devaluation risks during downturns.  
- **Impermanent Gain Mechanism:** Reinvest safe tokens into original pool assets during market recoveries, turning potential losses into profits.  
- **Incentivized Vaults:** Reward LPs for providing liquidity, especially in low-fee conditions, increasing market depth and competitiveness.
